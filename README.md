##rss


My own solution to replace Google Reader, still work-in-progress, but already fully useable.
You can use it directly on http://rss.bouh.org or you can self host it.

rss is [KISS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), so no social features or thing like that.

Some feed have a parser to extract the full article (like readability), you can submit your own parser.

* Starred items

* Responsive mode (can be used on mobile)
